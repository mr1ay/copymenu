
	Hi
	With this program, you can easily copy the plugins you use the most.

	How to use the program?
	You can click on the plugins in the menu.

	This Program uses the desktop as the location by default.
	If you want to change, press the other button on the location line. 
	
	Please copy any folder location within 5 seconds after clicking the button.
	After pressing the other button, if you want to use the desktop again, press the desktop button.

	Have a nice day
